# Blog-php-css-html
### What is this project about
 In this project I learned the basic skill of using php. I made a little blog with authorization mechanics for administrator of the blog, database of blog posts connecteted to web-site. Admin can delete, edit and add posts. Also you can open it in the new tab and read all it's text. In addition for database function I used XAMPP. For design I used Bootstrap.

### Ð urpose of folders and files in them

<li> Models actually contains realization of this functions.
